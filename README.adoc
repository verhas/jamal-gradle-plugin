A simple Github template that lets you create a *Gradle Plugin* üêò project using *100% Kotlin* and be up and running in a *few seconds*.

This template is focused on delivering a project with *static analysis* and *continuous integration* already in place.

== How to use üë£

Just click on image:https://img.shields.io/badge/-Use%20this%20template-brightgreen[Use this template,link=https://github.com/cortinico/kotlin-gradle-plugin-template/generate] button to create a new repo starting from this template.

Once created don't forget to update the:
- link:plugin-build/gradle.properties[gradle.properties]
- Plugin Usages (search for https://github.com/cortinico/kotlin-gradle-plugin-template/search?q=com.javax0.jamal.gradle&unscoped_q=com.javax0.jamal.gradle[com.javax0.jamal.gradle] in the repo and replace it with your ID).

== Features üé®

* *100% Kotlin-only template*.
* Plugin build setup with *composite build*.
* 100% Gradle Kotlin DSL setup.
* Dependency versions managed via Gradle Versions Catalog (`libs.versions.toml`).
* CI Setup with GitHub Actions.
* Kotlin Static Analysis via `ktlint` and `detekt`.
* Publishing-ready to Gradle Portal.
* Issues Template (bug report + feature request)
* Pull Request Template.

== Composite Build üì¶

This template is using a https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/composite_builds.html[Gradle composite build] to build, test and publish the plugin. This means that you don't need to run Gradle twice to test the changes on your Gradle plugin (no more `publishToMavenLocal` tricks or so).

The included build is inside the link:plugin-build[plugin-build] folder.

=== `preMerge` task

A `preMerge` task on the top level build is already provided in the template. This allows you to run all the `check` tasks both in the top level and in the included build.

You can easily invoke it with:

----
./gradlew preMerge

----

If you need to invoke a task inside the included build with:

----
./gradlew -p plugin-build <task-name>
----

=== Dependency substitution

Please note that the project relies on module name/group in order for https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/resolution_rules.html#sec:dependency_substitution_rules[dependency substitution] to work properly. If you change only the plugin ID everything will work as expected. If you change module name/group, things might break and you probably have to specify a https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/resolution_rules.html#sub:project_to_module_substitution[substitution rule].

== Publishing üöÄ

This template is ready to let you publish to https://plugins.gradle.org/[Gradle Portal].

The image:https://github.com/cortinico/kotlin-gradle-plugin-template/workflows/Publish%20Plugin%20to%20Portal/badge.svg?branch=1.0.0[Publish Plugin to Portal,link=https://github.com/cortinico/kotlin-gradle-plugin-template/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Publish+Plugin+to+Portal%22] Github Action will take care of the publishing whenever you *push a tag*.

Please note that you need to configure two secrets: `GRADLE_PUBLISH_KEY` and `GRADLE_PUBLISH_SECRET` with the credetials you can get from your profile on the Gradle Portal.

== 100% Kotlin üÖ∫

This template is designed to use Kotlin everywhere. The build files are written using https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/kotlin_dsl.html[*Gradle Kotlin DSL*] as well as the https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/plugins.html#sec:plugins_block[Plugin DSL] to setup the build.

Dependencies are centralized inside the link:gradle/libs.versions.toml[libs.versions.toml].

Moreover, a minimalistic Gradle Plugin is already provided in Kotlin to let you easily start developing your own around it.

== Static Analysis üîç

This template is using https://github.com/pinterest/ktlint[*ktlint*] with the https://github.com/jlleitschuh/ktlint-gradle[ktlint-gradle] plugin to format your code. To reformat all the source code as well as the buildscript you can run the `ktlintFormat` gradle task.

This template is also using https://github.com/arturbosch/detekt[*detekt*] to analyze the source code, with the configuration that is stored in the link:config/detekt/detekt.yml[detekt.yml] file (the file has been generated with the `detektGenerateConfig` task).

== CI ‚öôÔ∏è

This template is using https://github.com/cortinico/kotlin-android-template/actions[*GitHub Actions*] as CI. You don't need to setup any external service and you should have a running CI once you start using this template.

There are currently the following workflows available:
- link:.github/workflows/gradle-wrapper-validation.yml[Validate Gradle Wrapper] - Will check that the gradle wrapper has a valid checksum
- link:.github/workflows/pre-merge.yaml[Pre Merge Checks] - Will run the `preMerge` tasks as well as trying to run the Gradle plugin.
- link:.github/workflows/publish-plugin.yaml[Publish to Plugin Portal] - Will run the `publishPlugin` task when pushing a new tag.
